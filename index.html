            Beauty and the Beast is largely considered to have some of the best animation out of the Disney renaissance and a large part of it is the titular sequence and ballroom dance, a gorgeous shot showing a panorama of a large pan around spinning figures in a complex room, all things that are very hard to do in traditional animation. How Disney usually animates is the head animators will make key poses, a specially drawn frame every second or so and in between animators will draw around 11 frames connecting the key poses. the complications come with consistency between frames, rotation and spinning in 2d animation often doesn't hold consistency very well but Disney animations pulled this one off flawlessly

            In the 2000s disney the company started outsourcing to a small bteam the job of making direct to dvd sequels. These movies were purely money making endeavors and so had very low budget and manpower, this meant that framerate went down and preparation, didn’t happen. There was no aesthetically pleasing keyposes or transitional in betweens and instead just a series of pictures meaning it would hold on frames that were, well stuff like this. this isn't a cherry picked example there's plenty more where this comes from, and they held on this frame for multiple seconds.

              In fighting games animation serves a purpose over looking good, you need to be able to tell if you hit or get hit by what is on the screen. Emphasizing too much on how an animation looks in an isolated environment can come in conflict with what happnens in a match. For reasons like this games like this hold off on impressing you until they can be sure they know whats happening, like the fatalities that happen after someone wins and another persons inputs a specific set of buttons

              But when you don’t think of it you get stuff like melee marth grab. In this games community it has been memed to high hell about how long it is. But when the animation was shown in a public video alot of people didn’t believe it, because on its own it actually looks fine, the character leans forward and reaches out, but in real time the fully extended animation is only 1 frame, and if you hit someone on that frame it immediately pulls back making it look alot less reasonable than it actually is. Along with this confusing bit its at just the right height to hit other characters as they extend their limbs making it look even longer.
